# 2D Engine
This is a WIP simple 2D game engine based on the course "2D Game Engine with C++ and Lua", taught by Gustavo Pezzi at Pikuma.com.\
It is based on the entity component system framework with component-oriented and data-oriented design principles.\
I decided to undertake the challenge of making my own engine to de-mystify how engines work under the hood - asset management, physics and movement logic, input handling, etc.\
This is an ongoing personal project and is *not* ready for use to make games with yet - though it may be someday!\
I intend to continue iterating on this engine after finishing the course, expanding its features and even making some games with it eventually.\
